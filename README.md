# Linear-Discriminant-Regression-Classification-for-Face-Recognition
* Facial recognition techniques in Matlab
* Linear Discriminant Regression Classification is an algorithm improves the robustness of the linear regression classification (LRC) algorithm. 
* The program implements the  algorithm detailed in this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6373697
* Run the Facerecognition.mlapp app in matlab to see the algorithm in action.
